# VLSI_Design-Implementation
This repo is "NTHU VLSI System Design and Implementation" course project.
# Design Environment
NCverilog & nWave
# Lab01 Ping-Pong Counter
Design a 5-bit pingpong counter with inputs and output ports specification as requirement.
# Lab02 GCD Engine
Design a calculator to get the greatest common divisor of two integers.<br>
PartA: input two 8-bit integers while the input ports of A&B are also 8-bit<br>
PartB: input two 16-bit integers while the input ports of A&B are restricted by 8-bit<br>
# Lab03 Parameterized Ping-Pong Counter
Redesign Lab01 and parameterize all constants.<br>
- test pattern 04 with default 15 out signal errors!
# Project01 Local Median Filter Engine
Design a median filter engine to calculate any 2D grayscale image input, the mask size of the median filter is 7x7.<br>
# Lab04 APR Practice
Use the given file to implement block level APR by toturial flow<br>
# Project02 Sample Adaptive Offset Filter Engine
Design a SAO filter engine to calculate any 2D grayscale image input.<br>
