# Lab01 Ping-Pong Counter
Design a 5-bit pingpong counter with inputs and output ports specification as requirement.
# Lab02 GCD Engine
Design a calculator to get the greatest common divisor of two integers.<br>
PartA: input two 8-bit integers while the input ports of A&B are also 8-bit<br>
PartB: input two 16-bit integers while the input ports of A&B are restricted by 8-bit<br>
# Lab03 Parameterized Ping-Pong Counter
Redesign Lab01 and parameterize all constants.<br>
ï¼Štest pattern 04 with default 15 out signal errors!
